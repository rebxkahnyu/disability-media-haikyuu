        <h3><span class="h3">## introduction</span></h3>
        <p><span class="emphasis"><b><i>haikyuu!!</i></b></span> is an anime and manga series about high school volleyball, and that’s pretty much it. the main character is <span class="highlight">hinata shoyo</span> who is shorter than the average player, but has a huge love for the sport. it’s about his and other players' journeys in learning, playing, loving, and quitting the sport. despite its simple concept, it’s actually a compelling and convincing allegory for disability and the disabled experience.</p>

      <div class="hq4"><h5>volleyball and disability ?</h5>
        <p>*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ haikyuu was not written as a story about disability<br>
        ੈ✩‧₊˚ no one in the story is actually disabled<br>
        ｡･:*:･ this site was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Ludiscere">ludiscere</a> or alastair’s <a href="https://youtu.be/qS6zbSx4uhU">video essay</a> and experience as a disabled person<br>
        ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* this page will be summarizing part of his video and includes the discussion i had with him about quotes and parts of the series he did not mention in his video essay</p>

        <h5>this page contains <i>major spoilers</i> from the manga !!!</h5>
        <b>i personally recommend reading haikyuu first, but proceed at your own risk</b>

      <div class="hq7"><p>## basically, we’re going to take volleyball as a framework <b>analogous</b> to general modern society. so the characters playing volleyball can be representative of real people participating in and contributing to society.<br><br>
      ## there is no greater advantage in volleyball than being <b>tall</b>, and you have no control over your height.</p></div>

      <div class="hq8"><img id="hina" src="liddolhina.jpg" alt="Young Hinata Shoyo"></div>

      <div class="hq9">
        <p>hinata wants to participate in this sport despite his short height and the structural issues that limit his efficacy and success. <b>this is how it’s analogous to the disabled experience.</b><br><br>
        ultimately, haikyuu shows how society is built unfairly and how passion and desire is good but can’t make up for <span class="highlight">lack of equity.</span></p>
