        <p><span class="emphasis"><b><i>haikyuu!!</i></b></span> is an anime and manga series by furudate haruichi about high school volleyball, and that’s pretty much it. the main character is <span class="highlight">hinata shoyo</span> who is shorter than the average player, but has a huge love for the sport. it’s about his and other players' journeys in learning, playing, loving, and quitting volleyball. <u>despite its simple concept, it’s actually a compelling allegory for disability and the disabled experience.</u></p>

      <div class="hq11"><img id="middleschool1" src="middleschool1.jpg" alt="Hinata in middle school"></div>

      <div class="hq12"><p class="title"><u>no access</u></p><p>hinata sucks at volleyball. he has never had a team or teammates in middle school, and was never given the <span class="highlight">proper resources</span> to get any good at the sport. for more than half the series when he’s in high school, hinata does everything wrong and learns from his mistakes. <b>he tries his hardest every time</b>, but he can’t pass or receive the ball, can’t serve, can’t spike with his eyes open for a season and a half, and has an uncontrollable bowel before games. he’s a mess. <i>he is failed by the system around him that refused him support, therefore is inexperienced, and therefore struggles at volleyball. </i></p></div>

      <div class="hq13"><img id="middleschool2" src="middleschool2.jpg" alt="Hinata celebrating getting a point!"></div>

      <div class="hq14"><img id="hinastats" src="hinastats.jpg" alt="Hinata's Profile in the beginning of the series'"></div>

      <div class="hq15"><p>even when in high school he can’t play without the exceptional setter on his team and <span class="highlight">completely relies on someone else</span> to do what he loves most.</p></div>

      <div class="hq16"><img id="hinaalone" src="hinaalone.jpg" alt="Hinata is told he is the only one who signed up for the volleyball club in middle school"></div>

      <div class="hq17"><p class="title"><u>being able</u></p><p>>> but hinata improves as he is finally provided the resources, and is never babied by anyone for his height because he’s <b>much more than just a short player</b> who can spike a ball.<br><br>
      >> later he learns how to properly receive, learns that volleyball isn’t about tall height or strong power, and finds his own way of playing that <i>isn’t about his height or overcoming the lack of it.</i></p></div>

      <div class="hq18"><img id="makeup" src="makeup.jpg" alt="Tenma Udai saying 'I thought I had to rely on skill and technique to make up for my lack of height to succeed'"></div>

      <div class="hq20"><img id="hinatasick" src="hinatasick.jpg" alt="Hinata looks out to the distance after being taken out of his last game because of his fever."></div>

      <div class="hq21"><p>hinata has also always wanted to become the <span class="highlight">ace</span> of his team (the strongest player on the court), but later learns that he could never really become one, and that it’s okay. he completely lets go of that title in his last game of his first national tournament. in addition to this, <b>he gets slammed by a fever</b>, loses that last game, and goes on to never win a national tournament in his high school career.</p></div>

      <div class="hq22"><p class="title"><u>not unstoppable</u></p></div>

      <div class="hq23"><p>the fever is so important, and so uncomfortably relatable. alastair says it’s “the <b>overwhelming slump</b> after feeling alright for a while and then overdoing it because it <b>isn’t often you feel alright</b>.” hinata overdoes it because the success he’s wanted for so long was so close. he puts it in higher priority than his health. <span class="highlight">he tried his hardest, he wanted it enough,</span> but it’s all out of his control and that’s okay.</p></div>

      <div class="hq28"> <b>°:. *₊ ° DISCUSSION WITH ALASTAIR °:. *₊ °</b><p>this discussion would be much easier to understand if you read the manga, but feel free to read them anyway if you want!<br>p.s. manga is read from right to left!</p></div>

      <div class="hq29"><i>"i realized how important it was for hinata to lose, as well as give up the title of the ace that he once longed for so badly."</i></div>

      <div class="hq30"><p>"yeah exactly - that thing about <b>accepting a lack of control is so pivotal</b>, because both hinata and hoshiumi have a partner who supports them on that front, and shows them how sometimes things just aren't always going to go their way. like how kageyama says that it isn't for him decide how tanaka attacks when he sets for the line shot at the end of the inarizaki match, and hirugami constantly acts on korai's own advice, acting as living proof of how <span class="highlight">it'll still all go okay even if it doesn't go the way you hoped</span>, both of them setting an example for hinata and hoshiumi respectively. i love that, because <b>it's so hard to be disabled and alone, you need that unconditional support, but sometimes that support and example is best expressed through actions, not words.</b> beautiful storytelling."</p></div>

      <div class="hq31"><i>"what parts of haikyuu might be inspiration porn? if it exists, even though it’s not actually about disability."</i></div>

      <div class="hq32"><p>"haikyuu is probably the best example i've ever seen of making its content 'inspirational' without ever leaning too hard on trite cliches, and as such, i can't think of a single moment that would fit as an example. it's all done so tactfully. we see people be inspired by hinata all the time, he touches almost every character in the show in some sense - like how he helps <b>hyakuzawa</b> in the training camp arc, or how his appreciation for sets given with full effort gets to <b>atsumu</b>, or how <b>tsukki</b> repeatedly says that whenever he watches hinata 'buzz about' he feels like he has to get moving too - but <span class="highlight">he's never reduced to a caricature or one-dimensional figure whose only purpose is to benefit or motivate someone else.</span> i think it's pretty much flawless on that front."</p></div>

      <div class="hq33"><i>"if haikyuu is a story about underdogs, what makes it different from other media that have underdog stories? are they just mostly inspiration porn or not relatable?"</i></div>

      <div class="hq34"><p>"i think the ultimate difference is that by the end of most underdog stories, they end up <span class="highlight">eschewing the very trait that made them an underdog in the first place.</span> for most people trying to project themselves into these stories, that's really unrealistic - within the framework of disability, it's unlikely that you'll just get rid of it and live as if it never happened. that's why haikyuu stands out, it's a coming-of-age story where <b>hinata's challenges remain in the forefront the whole time, even when he's at his most successful.</b> he had no choice to become one of the best all-round players in japan, <b>otherwise he'd have no chance of even getting to stand on the court, the thing he wants to do most.</b> the bar is different for him. obviously not every story that's inspirational falls under the inspiration porn heading, but <span class="highlight">it usually depends on whether or not the authorial intent was to make a story that was above all else 'inspirational'. if so, they tend to lean on tropes and cliches more
      </span>, but haikyuu isn't predominantly a parable on inspiration, it's more complex than that. furudate didn't write it for the shallow reason of inspiring."</p>
      </div>

      <div class="hq35"><i>"i just wanted to ask your opinion about some parts in haikyuu that you haven’t mentioned in your video, such as tenma’s quote: “tall or short, anybody can have good skill and technique. all you have to do is practice. the world is fair, but at the same time it’s completely unfair.” is this not a good quote to connect with disability because volleyball and society are VERY different?"</i></div>

      <div class="hq36">
        <p>"that tenma quote is one of the best - the accompanying image where you see korai next to fukuro and ushiwaka is just perfect, one of the best from that whole final arc. of course you're right, society and volleyball being comparable is the basis of the video, but that doesn't hold up under scrutiny from every angle, i only really focused on the disability one - this quote however is tricky, because <br><span class="highlight">i think that the world, and disability by association, is predominantly unfair, and it's hard to think of anything fair about it, but i still think it lines up with the analogy.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        obviously there's so much variation, some people have congenital disabilities, some develop with age, some are caused from physical or mental trauma, and none of those situations can ever really be considered fair - despite that though, <b>the world is becoming more and more accessible and accommodating, and there's never been a better time to pursue your passions as a disabled person.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        i look at it like this: i can't walk without assistance, but there are <b>means put in place</b> so that people like me can still have independence - for example, i use a walking stick, which means i can usually walk around and keep up with my friends, and this is an example of how the world can be fair and equitable; however, even though i have the means to walk around with my friends, <b>it's never the exact same situation</b> - it hurts me more than them, it tires me out more, i worry more about how i appear on account of using a walking aid, and if a situation occurred where we had to do something like run to catch a bus, i wouldn't be able to keep up, and in this way, the world is totally unfair. <span class="highlight">me and my friends can all walk now, but my experiences are totally separate to theirs, just by virtue of our lives being set on different paths.</span> does that make sense?
        <br>
        <br>
        <u>that's how it is for hoshiumi and hinata too.</u> remember when yachi and yamaguchi are talking about how good hinata is at everything at the msby v adlers match, and then tsukki says something like 'well yeah, he has to be, otherwise there'd be no reason to put him in over a 6'10" cannon like barnes'? - if we refer back to my walking idea from before, it's like this: barnes is a tall fit man with a long stride, and can walk from place to place without much effort or thought, but if hinata was going to keep up with his pace, think how many more steps he'd have to do, how much more effort he'd have to expend? <b>this is how it's unfair. they can both walk, but over the same distance, hinata has had to do so much more to keep up, and that's bullshit.</b> although, that's why haikyuu is so amazing - <span class="highlight">he does keep up</span>, he acknowledges the lack of parity in the sport, and everyone acknowledges how amazing that feat is without ever condescending or pitying.</span> i love it."

      <div class="hq37"><img id="fair" src="fair.jpg" alt="Hoshiumi, Hirugami, and Ushijima's backs show Hoshiumi's short height compared to other players. Tenma says, 'the world is fair, but at the same time it’s completely unfair.'"></div>

      <div class="hq38"><i>"what's your opinion on washijo saying 'we weren't gifted with the body, but instead were given the hunger'? is it a reach to say he’s generalizing? i was thinking about how haikyuu could be an example of having the supercrip stereotype, but refuted myself by realizing this was more about the resources available to these short players in the environment they were given. they didn’t overcome their “disability”, they just had the resources to reach their full potential. it wasn’t some superpower they were suddenly given, they were able to play in the big leagues because of their accessibility to pursue their dreams."</i>

      <div class="hq39"><img id="hunger" src="hunger.jpg" alt="Washijo saying 'A powerful, driving hunger for height. whether you realize it or not. whether it's for better or for worse. that hunger is always there. the whims of fate may not have seen fit to give our bodies the size. what it gifted us instead is that hunger."></div>

      <div class="hq40">
        <p>
        "i think it's a general statement on the human tendency to want what you can't have, especially when you're so close to it. <u>there's no reason why a short player would love the sport any less than a tall player, but that doesn't necessarily equate to similar skill levels or chances of being picked.</u> loving something so much, trying as hard as everyone else, and then not being permitted to play would very often light a fire in that person, because <b>they have to try so much harder to be noticed.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        that ends up working with the disability analogy in the context of the show too, the whole <span class="highlight">'needing to try harder for the same result'</span> thing. yeah i don't think it's a supercrip thing either, because (in the first half of the story in particular) hinata has some exceptional talents, but is <b>woefully inadequate</b> in most facets of the game, and is usually the least technically proficient player on the court. obviously that changes, and there are certain moments (like late in the kamomedai match) where he feels unstoppable, but we soon learn he isn't when the fever strikes. haikyuu always strikes a <b>perfect balance</b> between <span class="highlight">empowering</span> its short characters and having their <span class="highlight">flaws or barriers</span> be acknowledged too.
        <br>
        <br>
        and yeah, <u>it's a resources thing</u> - korai went to a great school, had a professional level coach, good friends, and a very supportive family from a young age. <b>hinata had less</b>, but eventually found a team who <span class="highlight">supported him unconditionally</span>, a lifelong <span class="highlight">contemporary</span> in kageyama, takeda to help him <span class="highlight">mentally</span>, ukai to help his <span class="highlight">physically</span>, and then he's given the chance to <span class="highlight">live abroad</span> for two years to hone his skills. so yeah, i just think washijo's comment here is a wider idea on <b>human nature</b>, which ends up being relevant to the disability allegory we're imposing onto the show."
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="hq41"><i>"i was also wondering if you had any thoughts on takeda’s speech to hinata when he got his fever? he says a lot so i don’t wanna pick out a specific line, but i feel like some of it might relate to disability, i just don’t know how. i did, however, really like the line 'this too, is volleyball' as it sounds to me like 'this too, is life. the downs of being disadvantaged, the things you cannot control, are not a sign of weakness or incompetence, it is life.'"</i></div>

      <div class="hq42">
        <p>"yeah, the takeda one is interesting. firstly, i think <u>the fever is representative of the burnout you feel after overextension as a disabled person</u>, and takeda's speech is basically telling hinata that he can't defeat his physical limitations <b>just by willpower alone.</b> he says to remember how this exact moment feels so it doesn't happen again - every disabled person who has experienced this slump knows that exact feeling, the <span class="highlight">frustration</span>, the <span class="highlight">powerlessness</span>. takeda is suggesting we use this as motivation to better understand our boundaries, and i think it goes well with something ukai says to hinata after the game - <u>'don't try to surpass your limits. work to push those limits higher'</u>. and yes, i totally agree with your idea with volleyball and life being analogous. :)"
