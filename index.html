        <p>media that currently feature characters with disabilities are often misleading and lean heavily into pre-existing, incorrect stereotypes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="item6">
        <h4>% common tropes</h4><p>in fictional storylines include the <i>victim</i>, the <i>villain</i>, the <i>supercrip</i>, and <i>inspiration porn</i>.</p>

      <div class="item8">
        <p>“these storylines often reinforce the <b>superiority of people without disabilities</b> (and thus, the importance of “overcoming” a disability), <b>glorify those with disabilities for being able to live a normal or successful life</b>, and support the notion that <b>overcoming is a matter of personal character rather than highlighting institutional or structural barriers</b> that can make it more difficult for those living with disability to have the same resources and opportunities.”</p>

      <div class="item13"><p>there are other tropes including the portrayal of <b>prosthetics</b> that will be shortly mentioned later.</p></div>

      <div class="item14">
        <h5>// VICTIM</h5>
        <p>the victim or helpless stereotype portrays people as objects of <span class="highlight">pity and sympathy.</span> as needing to be “saved” from their condition rather than treated like a person. contrary to these depictions, people can have disabilities and live happy lives at the same time. <i>disability is not always bad, misfortunate, or as the lowest point in life compared to which every other life is better.</i> a popular example is a blind woman who is completely helpless and can’t do anything by herself, therefore making her look vulnerable, submissive, and incompetent.<br><br><span class="extraPara1"><span class="emphasis"><b>a note on gender:</b></span> it’s a popular trope where when a female character is disabled, she is helpless and needs saving, but when a male character is disabled, he has superpowers or is seen as impressive. men with disabilities are shown to be quirky or magical, while women are shown to be weak and always in need of help.</span></p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="item15"><p>the villain stereotype portrays disabled characters as being <span class="highlight">evil</span>, which feeds into the image that people with disabilities are <b>bad and violent.</b> characters have also been portrayed as being driven to crime or revenge by <b>resentment of their disability.</b> in fiction, mental illness is linked to violent crime very often, way too often, even though “most people who suffer from a mental illness are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators of violence.”<p></div>

      <div class="item18"><h5>%% SUPERCRIP</h5></div>

      <div class="item19">the supercrip stereotype portrays characters who have impairments that must <b>overachieve</b> and be <b>better than everyone else</b> in order to “overcome” their disability and be “normal.”</div>
      <div class="item20"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenshi_(Mortal_Kombat)"><img class="supercrip" src="supercrip.png" alt="Kenshi Takahashi, a blind character from Mortal Kombat"></a></div>
      <div class="item21">
        <p>it focuses on the individual who “succeeds” in <span class="emphasis"><b>overcoming</b></span> their disability, rather than the many others who must live with theirs. as a result, this may make people believe they do not have to do anything to accommodate people with disabilities, reinforcing the notion that disability can be overcome if only the person would <span class="emphasis"><b>“try hard enough.”</b></span> it’s a shocker; <i>yes</i>, people struggle with their disability! because storylines seem to like showing disabled people as superhumans who can overcome anything. there are good parts, but the bad parts are real too.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item22">depicting people with disabilities this way can also lead to people without disabilities looking to them for sources of inspiration and examples of courage rather than as regular people. which leads to inspiration porn.</div>

        <p><span class="emphasis"><b>inspiration porn</b></span> is a term created by Stella Young (you can watch her tedtalk <a href="https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw">here</a>) that describes a situation where a disabled person only <span class="highlight">exists as and is only seen as inspiration</span>. “it’s a portrayal of people with disabilities as one-dimensional saints who only exist to warm the hearts and open the minds of able-bodied people.” examples you might have seen before include quotes like “the only disability in life is a bad attitude” or a photo of someone in a wheelchair with the words “what’s your excuse?” plastered next to them. as if simply living their lives is something extraordinary.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item29"><p>there are countless news stories of kids with disabilities being included or sat next to during class. why is eating lunch with someone an act of charity? being friends or knowing someone who is disabled is not <b>volunteerism</b> or <b>community service</b>, but our culture seems to reinforce these views.</p></div>
      <div class="item30"><img class="inspoporn" src="inspoporn.jpg" alt="An image showing many different statements people can say about an disabled person to show how ~inspirational~ they are"></div>
      <div class="item31"><p>regarding inspiration, Stella Young states, “it says that if we fail to be happy, to smile and to live lives that make those around us feel good, it’s because we’re not trying hard enough. our attitude is just not positive enough. it’s our fault. not to mention</p></div>
      <div class="item32"><p> what it means for people whose disabilities are not visible, like people with chronic or mental illness, who often battle the assumption that it’s all about attitude. and we’re not allowed to be angry and upset, because then we’d be</p></div>
      <div class="item33"><p>'bad' disabled people.” disabled people can’t make their environment more accessible with a good attitude; smiling won't create a ramp for a wheelchair user, and a smile won't get rid of an intellectual disability.</p></div>
