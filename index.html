        <p>media that currently feature characters with disabilities are often misleading and lean heavily into pre-existing, incorrect stereotypes.</p>

      <div class="item6">
        <h4>% common tropes</h4><p>in fictional storylines include the <i>victim</i>, the <i>villain</i>, the <i>supercrip</i>, and <i>inspiration porn</i>.</p>

        <p>“these storylines often reinforce the <b>superiority of people without disabilities</b> (and thus, the importance of “overcoming” a disability), <b>glorify those with disabilities for being able to live a normal or successful life</b>, and support the notion that <b>overcoming is a matter of personal character rather than highlighting institutional or structural barriers</b> that can make it more difficult for those living with disability to have the same resources and opportunities.”<br>- See Jane 2020 Report</p>

        <h5>// VICTIM</h5>
        <p>the victim or helpless stereotype portrays people as objects of <span class="highlight">pity and sympathy.</span> as needing to be “saved” from their condition rather than treated like a person. contrary to these depictions, people can have disabilities and live happy lives at the same time. <i>disability is not always bad, misfortunate, or as the lowest point in life compared to which every other life is better.</i> a popular example is a blind woman who is completely helpless and can’t do anything by herself, therefore making her look vulnerable, submissive, and incompetent.<br><br><span class="extraPara1"><b>a note on gender:</b> it’s a popular trope where when a female character is disabled, she is helpless and needs saving, but when a male character is disabled, he has superpowers or is seen as impressive. men with disabilities are shown to be quirky or magical, while women are shown to be weak and always in need of help.</span></p>
